      <h2 class = "impressions">General Information</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="info">Xifu Food is a Chinese restaurant that offers a great variety of noodles that range from fried to soup based.</p>
      <p class="info">They offer a great variety of side dishes too that serve as great pairings with a noodle dish.</p>
      <p class="info">Xifu Food is about a 10 minutes walk from Tech. It is very close to Dekalb station and can be a convient place to stop by to get a quick bite to eat after school.</p>
      <p class="info">Most of the dishes are below $10 and aren't very expensive.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 class = "impressions">Impressions</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="info">Our general impression of the place was favorable. The diner itself is not the biggest so dining in may be tough especially with larger groups of people.</p>
      <p class="info">For this reason, it is easiest to get a spot with a smaller group of people if you want to dine in.</p>
      <p class="info">A good number of people to go with would be 2 or 3 if you do not want to go alone.</p>
      <p class="info">The wait times weren't really long and food came after about 10 minutes.</p>
      <p class="info">The food tasted very good and the portions were decent and we would recommend this place for any who are hungry and just want something quick to eat while dining in.</p>
