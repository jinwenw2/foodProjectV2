      <h2 class = "impressions">General Information</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="info">KPot is a great way to have a big meal with friends after school. It serves as an all you can eat place where you pick between either hotpot or BBQ.</p>
      <p class="info">They offer a variety and abundance of ingredients and you can cook them depending on the choice you made between hotpot and BBQ.</p>
      <p class="info">Hotpot features a pot over an electric stove where the food is cooked inside a pot that's full of soup. There is a grill too for those who chose BBQ.</p>
      <p class="info">You can choose to cook the food yourself or have a worker help prepare it for you. One of the best parts about hotpot and BBQ is that you can socialize with others while cooking for each other. This makes it best to come to KPot with bigger groups.</p>
      <p class="info">Kpot is also about a 10 minutes walk away from Tech and is near Dekalb station at Albee square.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class = "impressions">Negatives</h2>
      <p class="info">Although the food is good, Kpot is a lot more expensive than the other restaurants.</p>
      <p class="info">It opens directly at noon and lunch only lasts until 4. After 4pm, dinner starts and prices go from about $21 to $31. This can make it hard for students who end PD 10 to go during the cheaper time period.</p>
      <p class="info">Additionally, there is a price to pay if you order too much food and you don't finish it because it is an all you can eat place. Make sure you only order what you can finish!</p>
