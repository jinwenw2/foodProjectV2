    <h1 class="firstparagraph">Everyday, we all crave the healthy, hearty meal that our school provides us. The taste is
      simply exquisite. Don't you love the texture of soggy brocolli in your mouth or taste of artificial cheese? Look
      at the image below, doesn't that just look appetizing?</h1>

      <p class="fontMainPage">Okay. Obviously I was kidding. We see half-eaten or more likely, uneaten lunch left on
        cafeteria tables.</p>
      <p class="fontMainPage">The truth is that a lot of students tend to skip school lunch either because they dislike
        it or they are not satified with what is being offered.</p>
      <p class="fontMainPage">In order for school lunch to change for the entire, policies must be passed in order to
        revamp school lunches. This seems very unlikely in the long run and the presence of Meatless Mondays and
        Vegatarian Fridays only reinforces this.</p>
      <p class="fontMainPage">So, knowing that a lot of our peers may be skipping lunch, we wanted to offer some places
        where they can get some food after school. Most of these places will be located near Tech.</p>
      <p class="fontMainPage">We hope to not only just offer places to eat, but also places to possibly hang out with
        friends. After all, food often tastes better with others.</p>
